This demo requires the cart solver in addition to libTS (https://github.com/Time-Parallel/libTS)
-----
1. First install cart and libTS
2. Edit cartTS.py to point to the bin directories for both cart and libTS
3. Edit the input (inputs/cart/cart.in) and ensure that timeIntegrator is set to ts. Select the desired number of time samples (ninstances)
